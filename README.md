# Code Refactor for Horiseon

## Description

In an effort to make the Horiseon website compliant with modern accessibility standards, it was necessary to refactor the existing code base.

### Updates
* Added semantic elements to make the code/website clearer to developers and screen readers alike.
* Repaired broken link in the nav bar; search engine optimization in nav now correctly links to its corresponding section.
* Removed redundant class names for the header and footer, replacing them with semantic selectors.
* Organized CSS to follow the same structure as the HTML.
* Increased readability of CSS by consolidating redundant classes into fewer classes (see comments in CSS for details).
